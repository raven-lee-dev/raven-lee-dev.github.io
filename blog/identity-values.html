    <br>
    <h2 id="gradient-text">Psychiatric Comorbidities</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Unashamedly, in 2008, I was psychiatrically diagnosed with multiple concomitant cluster B and C disorders involving personality and mood disorders by a coworker of one of my uncle's (who is a prominent psychiatrist) after my mother (who was a licensed clinical psychologist) sought objective professional opinions and help. My conditions include C-PTSD (complex being the distinction), Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar Affective Disorder, OCD, depression, and panic/anxiety disorders.  </p>
    <br>
    <p>My afflictions are a consequence of chronic, long-term abuse during my formative years, as well as being in a coercively controlled and violent domestic relationship for 20-years with the father of my six children. Five years post-separation, my children and I are in an undisclosed location and have a 4th (and final) perpetual Domestic Violence
    order in place. Because of my Borderline condition, I have never had a stable sense of self/identity, so attempting to answer this question is almost impossible.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The key characteristics of Borderline Personality Disorder are:
      <ol>
        <li>An overwhelming fear of abandonment</li>
        <li>Unstable and intense interpersonal relationships</li>
        <li>Identity disturbance</li>
        <li>Impulsivity</li>
        <li>Suicidal ideation</li>
        <li>Affective instability/mood lability and chronic emotional dysregulation</li>
        <li>Feeling empty/dead inside, with an absence of an endoskeleton and exoskeleton</li>
        <li>Inappropriate and often disproportionate displays of anger/outbursts/rage</li>
        <li>Transient stress-induced paranoid ideation/psychotic symptomatology and/or dissociatve symptoms.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I won't bother posting lengthy videos and academic literature from leading global authorities (like psychiatrist Bessell van der Kolk, Frank Yeoman, Otto Kernberg, Marsha Lindehan, or Theodore Millon et al., but if anyone's interested in learning more about Borderline Personality Disorder, and C-PTSD, I think the following videos from a credible professional (licensed clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at CSU (California State University) Dr. Ramani Durvasula, are insightful and helpful.</p>

      <p>Psychologist Jonathan Haidt studies the five moral values that form the basis of our political choices, whether
        we're left, right, or center. In this eye-opening talk, he pinpoints the moral values that liberals and conservatives
        tend to honor most. Jonathan Haidt studies how -- and why -- we evolved to be moral. By understanding more about our
        moral roots, his hope is that we can learn to be civil and open-minded.</p>

      <h1 id="gradient-text">Agreeableness:<div>Compassion and Politeness</div>
      </h1>
      <br>

      <p>You have just completed assessing yourself with 100 phrases. Our systems have compared your-self-ratings to
        those of thousands of other people. You are being compared to men and women of all ages. This means that if you are
        young, your scores on neuroticism will be higher and on agreeableness and conscientiousness will be lower than if you were
        compared to people of your own age (with the reverse being true for older individuals).</p>
      <br>
      <p>For men, their scores on agreeableness and on neuroticism will be lower than if they were just being compared
        to men. We decided to make the comparisons simple, so that you know where you stand in comparison to the typical person
        (with age and sex regarded as irrelevant).</p>
      <br>
      <p>Here are your results. You will see below where you stand in comparison to others in the general population on
        the major traits and their aspects:</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Agreeableness:<div>Compassion and Politeness</div>
        </li>
        <li>Conscientiousness:<div>Industriousness and Orderliness</div>
        </li>
        <li>Extraversion:<div>Enthusiasm and Assertiveness</div>
        </li>
        <li>Neuroticism:<div>Withdrawal and Volatility</div>
        </li>
        <li>Openness to Experience:<div>Openness and Intellect</div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>Remember that each personality trait and aspect (and your relative position with respect to them) has
        advantages and disadvantages. It is for that reason that variation exists in the human population: there is a niche for each
        personality configuration. Much of what constitutes success in life is therefore the consequence of finding the
        place in relationships, work and personal commitment that corresponds to your unique personality structure. Good luck
        with your expanded self-understanding!</p>
      <br>
      <p>Note also that if you find that the descriptions harsher than you might consider appropriate this may mean that
        you were more self-critical than necessary when completing the questions (remember, the results are based on your own
        self-report, compared to that of others). This can occur if you were feeling temporarily or chronically unhappy
        or anxious, or hungry, angry or judgmental when you completed the questions.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="gradient-text">Agreeableness:<div>Exceptionally Low</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>You are exceptionally low in agreeableness, which is the primary dimension of Interpersonal interaction in the
        Big Five personality trait scientific model. Agreeableness has two aspects: compassion and politeness, which will be
        explained separately. Agreeableness is a very complex trait, with marked positive and negative elements all along its
        distribution. Because of this, higher scores and lower scores need to be explained at the same time.</p>
      <br>
      <p>People high in agreeableness are nice: compliant, nurturing, kind, naively trusting and conciliatory. However,
        because of their tendency to avoid conflict, they often dissemble and hide what they think. People low in agreeableness
        are not so nice: stubborn, dominant, harsh, skeptical, competitive and, in the extreme, even predatory. However, they
        tend to be straightforward, even blunt, so you know where they stand.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Your score puts you at the 0th percentile for agreeableness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would
        be less agreeable than 99 of them and more agreeable than 0 of them.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="gradient-text">Agreeableness<div>0th percentile</div>
        <div>You are less agreeable than 99 of 100 people</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>People with exceptionally low levels of agreeableness are seen by others as markedly competitive, colder,
        tougher and very much less empathic. They do not easily see the best in others, and are not particularly tolerant (an
        attitude that is much valued by agreeable people). They are very much less concerned about the emotional state of others, are
        uncommonly willing to engage in conflict, and will happily sacrifice peace and harmony to make a point or (if
        conscientious) to get things done. People may find them painfully straightforward and blunt. They tend very
        strongly towards dominance, rather than submission (particularly if also below average in neuroticism).</p>
      <br>
      <p>People with exceptionally low levels of agreeableness do not at all easily forgive. They are definitely not
        accepting, flexible, gentle or patient. They feel minimal pity for those who are excluded, punished or defeated, and
        attribute such problems to weakness or inability. They are also extremely unlikely to be taken advantage of by disagreeable,
        manipulative or otherwise troublesome people, or those with criminal or predatory intent. Their extraordinarily
        high levels of skepticism play a protective role, although it often interferes with their ability to cooperate with
        or trust others whose intentions are genuinely good.</p>
      <br>

      <p>They are also much less likely to reward good behavior or to give credit where it is due. They cooperate
        grudgingly, and only when cooperation is in their clear self-interest, preferring competition, with its well-defined losers
        and winners. They do not lose arguments (or avoid discussions) with anyone, for any reason, and enjoy the battle. This can
        interfere with their ability to learn from experience (their own or others’). They are very likely to be expert at bargaining
        for themselves, and at negotiating for more recognition or power, and are likely to have higher salaries and to earn more money,
        in consequence.</p>
      <br>
      <p>People exceptionally low in agreeableness are therefore less likely to suffer from resentment or to harbor
        invisible anger. They let you know exactly what they think, when they think it, whether you want to know it or not. In
        addition, because of their tendency to engage in conflict, at a moment’s notice, people exceptionally low in agreeableness
        do not sacrifice medium- to long-term stability and functionality for the sake of short-term peace. This means that
        problems that should be solved in the present are often solved, quickly and harshly. This means that such problems may
        not accumulate counterproductively across time.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The price paid for this? People close to those exceptionally low in areeableness will frequently experience
        them as overbearing and uncaring.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Women are higher in agreeableness than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and
        men) is 61.5. For men it is 38.5. The fact that men are lower in agreeableness than women helps explain their much
        higher rates of criminal incarceration (90% male). The primary difference between criminals and non-criminals is
        disagreeableness. If the typical criminal is more disagreeable than 98% of people in the general population, then almost all those
        criminals will be male. This difference in agreeableness between men and women is largest in countries such as Norway and
        Sweden, where the most has been done to ensure equality of outcome between the sexes. This provides strong evidence that
        biological factors rather than environment and learning account for the dissimilarity.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Agreeableness, per se, is not strongly associated with political liberalism or conservatism, but this is
        because the aspects of agreeableness predict such political belief in opposite ways, and cancel each other out. Liberals are
        higher in aspect compassion, and conservatives in aspect politeness. However, alliance with the category of belief that
        has come to be known as politically correct is strongly predicted by agreeableness (particularly compassion). What
        this appears to mean is that agreeable people strongly identify with those they deem oppressed, seeing them,
        essentially, as exploited infants, and demonize those they see as oppressors, seeing them as cruel, heartless predators.</p>
      <br>
      <p>There are large differences between men and women in terms of spontaneous interest, and these also appear
        associated with agreeableness. Agreeable people, caring as they do for others, are more likely to enter professions
        associated with people, such as teaching and nursing, which are dominated by women. This is true even in the Scandinavian
        countries, where attempts to produce gender-equal societies has reached a maximum. Disagreeable people, by contrast, appear
        to prefer systematizing over empathizing, and are more interested in things – machines and technology. In
        consequence, professions such as engineering and trades associated with construction and machinery tend to be dominated by
        relatively disagreeable men.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Agreeableness has two aspects:
      <div>compassion and politeness.</div>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="gradient-text">Compassion:<div>Very Low</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>You are very low in compassion, which is one aspect of Agreeableness. Your score puts you at the 5th percentile
        for compassion. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less compassionate than 94 of them and more
        compassionate than 5 of them.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Very much less compassionate people are not oriented towards the problems of other people or other living
        things. They are not swayed by helplessness or cuteness. They are very willing to make other people experience negative
        emotion by engaging in conflict and competition. They want to win, and will engage in the confrontation necessary to do so.
        They are very much less concerned about helping other people. They make certain their own needs and interests are
        attended to, and are markedly unwilling to sacrifice for the sake of other people’s comfort. This can make them both
        harsh and unsympathetic. People might turn to them for the cold, hard truth, but not for a soft, patient,
        eternally-listening ear.  They are very much less empathetic and caring. However, because they are not primarily other-oriented, they
        negotiate very effectively on their own behalf, and are likely to get at least what they deserve and perhaps more (for
        their hard work, for example). In consequence, they are unlikely to harbor feelings of resentment or hidden anger.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="gradient-text">Compassion<div>5th percentile</div>
        <div>You are less compassionate than 94 of 100 people</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>Those who are liberal, politically, score somewhat higher in compassion than conservatives.
        Women are also higher in compassion than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and
        men) is 61. For men it is 39.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="gradient-text">Politeness:<div>Exceptionally Low</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>You are exceptionally low in politeness, which is one aspect of Agreeableness. Your score puts you at the 0th
        percentile for politeness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less polite than 99 of them and more
        polite than 0 of them.</p>
      <br>
      <p>People who are exceptionally low in politeness challenge and confront authority – and they are not obedient. If
        they are respectful, it is grudgingly, and will only be manifested toward people who continually both deserve and demand
        it. They are comfortable confronting other people, and enjoy it. People extremely low in politeness are motivated to
        engage in conflict, and to seek out confrontation. They may have a strong tendency toward conduct-disordered, antisocial,
        delinquent, even criminal behavior, particularly if male and adolescent. They may find themselves very
        frequently in trouble with authority, in consequence. Their skepticism can make it extremely difficult for them to find a
        place in the middle or lower in hierarchies of power and dominance. They are hyper-dominant, rather than submissive
        (particularly if they are also low in neuroticism).</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="gradient-text">Politeness<div>0th percentile</div>
        <div>You are less polite than 99 of 100 people</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>Those who are liberal, politically, score somewhat lower in politeness than conservatives (the opposite pattern
        is seen with compassion). Women are higher in politeness than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population
        (women and men) is 59. For men it is 41.</p>

      <h1 id="gradient-text">Conscientiousness:<div>Industriousness and Orderliness</div>
      </h1>
      <br>
      <h2 id="gradient-text">Conscientiousness:<div>Very Low</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>You are very low in conscientiousness, which is the primary dimension of dutiful achievement in the Big Five
        personality trait scientific model. Conscientiousness is a measure of obligation, attention to detail, hard
        work, persistence, cleanliness, efficiency and adherence to rules, standards and processes. Conscientious people implement their
        plans and establish and maintain order. Your score puts you at the 4th percentile for conscientiousness. If you were
        one of 100 people in a room, you would be less conscientious than 95 of them and more conscientious than 4 of them.</p>
      <br>
      <p>People very low in conscientiousness do not regard duty as at all important. They are likely to regard those
        who slog away at their task as suckers, teacher’s pets and boot-lickers. They will only work hard if directly and
        continually pushed by outside forces (supervisors, spouses, friends, parents). They can be very creative at wasting time.
        They are very likely to procrastinate (particularly if they are also above average in neuroticism). Even if they do
        commit to doing something, it is very likely they will be late, or delayed, even when there is no reason for failing to
        deliver.
        They formulate and deliver excuses for their failure under such circumstances, blaming the situation for their
        problems with task focus and completion. They are not at all decisive, neat, organized, future-oriented, or
        reliable, and they find themselves constantly distracted.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="gradient-text">Conscientiousness<div>4th percentile</div>
        <div>You are less conscientious than 95 of 100 people</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>People with very low levels of conscientiousness are very likely to obtain poor grades in academic settings
        (particularly if they also less intelligent), and generally require substantial supervision to stay on task. For
        this reason, they make poor managers and administrators. They are not compelled to do things by the book, however.
        This can perhaps be an advantage, if they are engaged in creative tasks, where rules must be broken for advancement to
        take place. Very unconscientious people will not make career or educational accomplishment a primary goal, and will
        turn instead to pursuit of safety and security (if high in neuroticism), creative accomplishment (if high in
        openness), establishment of intimate relationships and friendships (if highly agreeable), or social success, excitement and
        fun (if extraverted). They are by no means ambitious.</p>
      <br>
      <p>People very low in conscientiousness tend to be markedly free of guilt, shame, self-disgust and self-contempt.
        Other people, however, are very likely to react negatively to their tendency to slack off and avoid responsibility
        (particularly if those other people are disagreeable and conscientious).</p>
      <br>
      <p>Individuals who are very low in conscientious appear unconcerned by failure. They are not at all judgmental, to
        themselves or others, and can easily and quickly find and formulate situational explanations for disappointment,
        frustration or lack of success. They can handle periods of inactivity and unemployment with ease. They
        chronically downplay the relationship between hard work, diligence and success, assuming instead that chance factors and
        luck in life play the only determining roles. They live for leisure and very much look forward to time off. They can be
        remarkably good at relaxing, taking it easy, and living in the moment (particularly when low in neuroticism).
        They are very much less concerned than average with cleaning, moral purity and achievement. It’s far more fun to be at
        the beach or at a party with a person very low in conscientiousness – but you don’t want to invite them over on moving
        day.</p>
      <br>
      <p>People very low in conscientiousness are strikingly more likely to be political liberals rather than
        conservatives. This is particularly true if they are also high in openness. Women are very slightly more conscientious than men. The
        mean percentilefor women in a general population (women and men) is 51.5. For men it is 49.5. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Conscientiousness has two aspects:
      <div>industriousness and orderliness.</div>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="gradient-text">Industriousness:<div>Exceptionally Low</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>You are exceptionally low in industriousness, which is one aspect of conscientiousness. Your score puts you at
        the 3rd percentile for industriousness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less industrious than 96
        of them and more industrious than 3 of them.</p>
      <br>
      <p>People who are exceptionally low in industriousness are extremely unlikely to be successful in school and in
        administrative and managerial positions (particularly if they are also less intelligent). If they are highly
        intelligent, they will almost certainly be regarded as underachievers, by themselves and others. They don’t
        regard work as worthwhile or important, and are almost certain to procrastinate, miss deadlines, or fail to complete
        assignments or projects completely. They shirk all responsibility, concentrating on fun, worry, relationships, excitement or
        creative endeavor. They aren’t all concerned with or interested in schedules, timelines or efficiency, and are unlikely
        to complete their tasks even if supervised excessively. They lack focus and are far too-easily and continually
        distracted.</p>
      <br>
      <p>People exceptionally low in industriousness are not at all judgmental to themselves or others. They continually
        and habitually let people, including themselves, off the hook. They insist that people fail not because they don’t
        apply themselves or work hard but because chance and luck play the only determining roles. They are very resistant to
        guilt, self-disgust or self-contempt, and have a totally laissez-faire, whatever-will-be-will-be attitude toward life.
        Those who are liberal and those who are conservatives appear equally industrious. Men are slightly more industrious than
        women. The mean percentile for men in a general population (women and men) is 51.5. For women it is 49.5.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="gradient-text">Orderliness:<div>Low</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>You are low in orderliness, which is one aspect of conscientiousness. Your score puts you at the 12th
        percentile for orderliness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less orderly than 87 of them and more orderly
        than 12 of them.</p>
      <br>
      <p>People low in orderliness are not disturbed, upset or disgusted by mess, disorder and chaos. They simply don’t
        notice such things (or, if they do, they don’t care). They see the world in shades of grey, not in black and white, and
        are very non-judgmental and devil-may-care in their attitudes toward themselves and others. They don’t use
        schedules, list, or routines and, even if they plan, rarely implement those plans, preferring to take things as they come, and
        let chance determine the outcome. They are not oriented toward detail and do not abide by rules or procedures.</p>
      <br>
      <p>People who are low in orderliness don’t care for routine and predictability. Their schedules are loose, their
        time unscheduled, and disruption doesn’t bother them. They require constant reminder and supervision to maintain
        attention and focus, and are too-easily distracted. They can, however, tolerate the mess, disruption and intervening
        periods of chaos that may accompany creative endeavour. Those who are low in orderliness are much less likely to be
        political conservatives. Orderliness is the second-best predictor of conservatism, after openness to experience.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Women are more orderly than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 54.5.
        For men it is 45.5. This may account for some of the trouble in relation to housework between women and men. Since women
        are, on average, more orderly, household disorder will trigger disgust and discomfort in them faster. This may happen
        with sufficient frequency so they end up doing a disproportionate share of such work (even though if they waited a
        bit longer their less orderly partners, often men, might end up equally troubled and motivated to fix the problem). Orderly
        people are more likely to have items such as event calendars, drawer organizers, laundry baskets, irons and ironing
        boards in their immediate environments.</p>

      <h1 id="gradient-text">Extraversion:<div>Enthusiasm and Assertiveness</div>
      </h1>
      <br>
      <h2 id="gradient-text">Extraversion:<div>High</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>You are high in extraversion, which is the primary dimension of positive emotion in the Big Five personality
        trait scientific model. Extraversion is a measure of general sensitivity to positive emotions such as hope, joy,
        anticipation and approach, particularly in social situations. Your score puts you at the 86th percentile for extraversion. If
        you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more xtraverted than 86 of them and less extraverted than 13 of them.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>People with high levels of extraversion are comparatively enthusiastic, talkative, assertive in social
        situations, and gregarious. They are typically energized by social contact, and crave it. They take great pleasure in planning
        parties, telling jokes, making people laugh, and taking part in community activities. They are likely to have positive
        memories of the past, high levels of current self-esteem (particularly if they are low in neuroticism), and to feel
        positive and optimistic about the future.</p>
      <br>
      <p>People who are highly extraverted have a difficult time keeping things to themselves, and tend to tell everyone
        everything. They are self-disclosing (particularly if also high in neuroticism) and they warm up quickly to
        other people. They tend to speak first and most often in meetings. They can be captivating and convincing. They will
        often be the first to act. People who are high in extraversion make enthusiastic employees, and are well-suited to jobs
        involving sales, persuasion, work in groups and public speaking (particularly, once again, if they are low in neuroticism). They
        are not as suited to occupations that require a lot of isolated work (such as computer programming or accounting).</p>
      <br>
      <p>People high in extraversion can also be impulsive, particularly when it comes to having fun in social
        situations. They are more likely than average to sacrifice the future to the present, when something social or group-oriented
        beckons. It is somewhat difficult for them to be alone and to study and work. They can be easily distracted by opportunities
        to chat, joke and socialize. This is particularly the case if they are also low in conscientiousness. When
        individuals are extraverted and conscientious, they are more productive than if they are introverted and conscientious. However,
        when they are introverted and unconscientious, they are more productive than they are when they are extroverted and
        unconscientious.</p>
      <br>
      <p>People high in extraversion are more dominant in social situations, particularly if they are also low in
        agreeableness. Less agreeable extraverts tend to be self-centered – something that can be made worse if they are also low in
        conscientiousness. Those who are politically liberal are slightly less extraverted than conservatives.
        Women are slightly more extraverted than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and
        men) is 52. For men it is 48. Extraversion has two aspects: Enthusiasm and Assertiveness.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="gradient-text">Enthusiasm:<div>Moderately Low</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>You are moderately low in enthusiasm, which is one aspect of extraversion. Your score puts you at the 30th
        percentile for enthusiasm. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less enthusiastic than 69 of them and more
        enthusiastic than 30 of them.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Individuals who are moderately low in enthusiasm are rarely excitable, not particularly easy to get to know,
        and not known for their talkative nature. When they do talk, it tends only to be about things in which they find
        particular interest. They do not easily open up to people, particularly in larger social gatherings or parties. They laugh
        more rarely than others. They tend to prefer solitude, although they can enjoy themselves around other people, in
        moderation. They are more private people, and are not particularly positive or optimistic. They do not crave the spotlight
        and, if creative, may find performing less desirable. They rarely seek out stimulation, excitement, activity or fun
        (and, if they do so, prefer quieter activities). People moderately low in enthusiasm are not gregarious or people-loving,
        and are not particularly positive about what might happen next .</p>
      <br>
      <p>Enthusiasm is not strongly associated with political preference, either conservative or liberal. Women are
        higher in enthusiasm than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 55. For men it is
        45.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="gradient-text">Assertiveness:<div>Exceptionally High</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>You are exceptionally high in assertiveness, which is one aspect of extraversion. Your score puts you at the
        98th percentile for assertiveness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more assertive than 98 of
        them and less assertive than 1 of them.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Exceptionally assertive people are “take charge” types. They put their own opinions forward extremely strongly,
        and constantly dominate and control social situations. Exceptionally assertive people can be extremely influential
        and captivating. They have the communication style that is often associated with leadership. This is good when they
        are knowledgeable, competent and able, but not so good when they aren’t. Assertive people are people of action. They
        don’t wait for others to lead the way, but leap in, heedlessly. They can be impulsive, in consequence, and can act
        without thinking.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Liberals tend to be slightly less assertive than conservatives. Women are slightly less assertive than men. The
        mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 48. For men it is 52.</p>

      <h2 id="gradient-text">Neuroticism:<div>Withdrawal and Volatility</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>You are exceptionally high in neuroticism, which is the primary dimension of negative emotion in the Big Five
        personality trait scientific model. Neuroticism is a measure of general sensitivity to negative emotions such as
        pain, sadness, irritable or defensive anger, fear and anxiety.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Your score puts you at the 98th percentile for neuroticism. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would
        be higher in neuroticism than 98 of them and lower in neuroticism than 1 of them.</p>
      <br>
      <p>People with exceptionally high levels of neuroticism are more likely to think that things have gone wrong in
        the past, are going wrong now, and will continue to go wrong into the future. They are also more likely to be
        unhappy, anxious and irritable when just thinking or remembering, and when they encounter a genuine problem. They have unusually
        low levels of self-esteem, particularly when they are also low in extraversion. Neuroticism is a risk factor for anxiety
        disorders and depression.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Exceptionally high levels of neuroticism are likely to interfere with both success and satisfaction in
        relationships and career, with the strongest effect on relationships. Exceptionally high levels of neuroticism are associated
        with constant concern about mental and physical health, far more physician and emergency room visits, and very
        frequent absenteeism at work and at school (particularly if accompanied by below average levels of conscientiousness).
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>People with exceptionally high levels of neuroticism appear to be extremely risk-averse, which means they will
        avoid recreational, career, financial and social situations where the possibility of loss is high. Such people appear
        to be unusually concerned with maintaining their current status, rather than enhancing it. Perhaps this is a good
        strategy in genuinely dangerous or uncertain times.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Neuroticism is not a powerful predictor of political belief, either conservative or liberal.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Females tend to be higher in neuroticism than males. The typical woman is higher in neuroticism than 60% of the
        general population of men and women combined. In part, this may be why women report more unhappiness in their
        relationships, at work, in school and with their health than men, on average, and why women initiate 70% of all divorces. This
        difference in neuroticism between men and women appears to emerge at puberty. It is largest in countries such as
        Norway and Sweden, where the most has been done to ensure equality of outcome between the sexes. This provides strong
        evidence that biological factors rather than environment and learning account for the dissimilarity.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Trait neuroticism is made up of the aspects withdrawal and volatility.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="gradient-text">Withdrawal:<div>High</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>You are high in withdrawal, which is one aspect of neuroticism. Your score puts you at the 83rd percentile for
        withdrawal. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be higher in withdrawal than 83 of them and lower
        in withdrawal than 16 of them.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Individuals high in withdrawal may feel above average levels of anticipatory anxiety. This makes it much more
        challenging for them to approach new, uncertain, unexpected, threatening or complex situations. They are instead
        substantially more likely to avoid or withdraw in the face of the unknown and unexpected.</p>
      <br>
      <p>People high in withdrawal much more frequently feel sad, lonesome, disappointed and grief-stricken. They have
        higher than average levels of doubt and worry, become embarrassed easily, are self-conscious and strongly tend to get
        discouraged in the face of threat and punishment. Their anticipatory anxiety is likely to be general. They are
        sensitive to social rejection, and can be relatively easily hurt. Once hurt, frightened, or anxious, as well, it
        takes them longer to recover. They can be argumentative and lose their composure. They can be provocative in a dispute
        (particularly if also low in agreeableness). Perhaps people high in withdrawal are concerned that something bad might happen,
        while people high in volatility (the other aspect of neuroticism) get upset if something bad does happen. Technically,
        withdrawal has been associated with activity in the brain systems that regulate passive avoidance.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Those who are liberal, politically, are slightly higher in withdrawal than conservatives. Women are higher in
        withdrawal than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 60. For men it is
        40.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="gradient-text">Volatility:<div>Exceptionally High</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>You are exceptionally high in volatility, which is one aspect of neuroticism. Your score puts you at the 99th
        percentile for volatility. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more volatile than 99 of them
        and less volatile than 0 of them.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Individuals exceptionally high in volatility tend to vary a great deal in their mood. They can be extremely
        irritable, reacting quite strongly to disappointment, frustration, pain and the threat of social isolation. They
        can lash out and are unusually easily annoyed. They are likely to act out or verbally express their frustration, disappointment
        and irritability. They can be exceptionally easily stirred up and upset and, once angry or irritated, take a
        comparatively long time to calm down. They may be argumentative and can lose their composure. Perhaps people exceptionally
        high in volatility get very upset if something bad does happen, while people high in withdrawal (the other aspect of
        neuroticism) are extremely concerned that something bad might happen. Technically, volatility has been
        associated with activity in the brain systems that regulate fight, flight or freeze.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Volatility is not strongly related to political preference, either liberal or conservative. Women are higher in
        volatility than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 57.5. For men it
        is
        42.5.</p>

      </h2>
      <br>
      <h2 id="gradient-text">Oppenness to Experience:<div>High</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>You are high in openness to experience, which is the primary dimension of creativity, artistic interest and
        intelligence (particularly verbal intelligence) in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. Openness to
        experience is a measure of interest in novelty, art, literature, abstract thinking, philosophy as well as sensitivity to
        aesthetic emotions and beauty.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Your score puts you at the 83rd percentile for openness to experience. If you were one of 100 people in a room,
        you would be higher in openness to experience than 83 of them and lower in openness to experience than 16 of them.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>People with high levels of openness to experience are much more likely than average to be characterized by
        others as smart, creative, exploratory, intelligent and visionary. They are highly interested in learning, and continually
        acquire new abilities and skills. They are very curious and exploratory. They find themselves unusually
        interested in abstract thinking, philosophy, and the meaning of belief systems and ideologies. They will seek out cultural events such
        as movies, concerts, dance recitals, plays, poetry readings, gallery openings and art shows. They are very likely
        to enjoy writing (or even to be driven to write). They enjoy complex, abstract ideas and love to confront and solve
        complex, abstract and multi-dimensional problems.</p>
      <br>
      <p>They are very likely to be prolific readers, with a strikingly wide range of interests. They have an atypically
        broad and deep vocabulary. They can think and learn very quickly. They are very proficient at formulating new ideas,
        and tend strongly to be articulate (particularly if average or above in extraversion). People high in openness can
        see old things in new ways. They can formulate any single problem in a highly diverse range of ways, and can generate a
        very large number of problem-solving solutions. They seek change, often to make things better, but also just for the sake
        of change.</p>
      <br>
      <p>People who are high in openness to experience are less well adapted to and tend to do less well in situations
        or occupations that are routinized and predictable. They do not fit in very well at the bottom of hierarchies. They
        are typically ill-suited to entry-level, repetitive, rote positions, because they are always thinking up new ways to
        do things, and such ideas are seldom welcome from someone at the bottom. They are radical thinkers. They shake
        things up, particularly if they are also disagreeable and assertive. They are somewhat more likely to be revolutionary
        rebels (particularly if average or below in conscientiousness).</p>
      <br>
      <p>Individuals high in openness to experience tend strongly to be entrepreneurial in spirit, as well as smart and
        creative. They have much higher than average interest in creating new ventures, sometimes for profit, sometimes
        for curiosity, and sometimes for personal transformation. High levels of openness to experience appear necessary to the
        formation and leadership of business and other forms of complex organization, although conscientiousness appears required for
        the attention to detail and process management that such organizations also always need.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Because people who are high in openness to experience tend to be interested in almost everything, this can make
        it harder for them to settle on a single path in life, to specialize to a necessary degree, and to create an
        integrated identity. This problem can be exaggerated if they are high in neuroticism and/or low in conscientiousness.
        People characterized by the combination of high openness to experience and high neuroticism often undermine their own
        convictions and beliefs by questioning and making themselves lost and anxious. Open, unconscientious people tend
        to be “under-achievers” (particularly if also above average in neuroticism). Such people appear to have the capability
        to succeed, can learn quickly, and are creative, but they can have some trouble implementing their ideas.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Openness to experience is the dimension that best predicts political allegiance (with conscientiousness,
        particularly the aspect of orderliness, coming in at second place). Those who are liberal, politically, are very much more
        likely to be high in openness to experience than conservatives. Women and men differ very little in openness to
        experience at the trait level, although there are differences in the aspect levels. Trait openness to experience is made up of
        the aspects of intellect and openness.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="gradient-text">Intellect:<div>Very High</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>Note: Do not confuse the personality aspect of Intellect with IQ. Intellect is a measure of interest in
        abstract ideas, essentially, while IQ is a measure of processing speed, verbal ability, working memory, and problem solving
        capacity, and is better measured with a formal IQ test. It is perfectly possible to have a high IQ and a low score on the
        personality trait of Intellect (or the reverse). You are very high in intellect, which is one aspect of openness
        to experience. Your score puts you at the 94th percentile for intellect. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be
        higher in intellect than 94 of them and lower in intellect than 5 of them.</p>
      <br>
      <p>People very high in intellect are notably interested in ideas and abstract concepts. They crave exposure to
        novel information, even when it is complex. They are highly curious and exploratory, and actively want to find, tackle
        and solve challenging problems. They will much more frequently seek out and initiate issue-oriented discussions, and
        are very likely to read, think about and want to discuss idea-centered books (generally non-fiction). They are
        markedly articulate, and can formulate ideas clearly and quickly (particularly if average or higher in extraversion).
        They have a broad and wide vocabulary, and continually want to learn new things. People very high in intellect will
        constantly find and generate novel, creative concepts and voluntarily search for and adapt very well to new experience and
        situations.</p>
      <br>
      <p>People very high in intellect find complex, rapidly changing occupations necessary and will generally excel at
        them (particularly if they are also high in conscientiousness and low in neuroticism). However, they are very much
        less well-suited to stable, straightforward and more traditional occupations, where the rules don't change, and will
        experience frequent periods of boredom and intolerable levels of frustration in such positions.

        Liberals are higher in intellect than conservatives (although the biggest difference between the two is openness
        to experience at the trait level).

        Women are lower than men in intellect (although not in IQ). This is probably a difference in interest: people
        high in intellect, compared to openness, are more likely to prefer the sciences to the arts. The mean percentile for
        women in a general population (women and men) is 45. For men it is 55.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="gradient-text">Openness:<div>Typical or Average</div>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>You are average in openness, which is one aspect of openness to experience. Your score puts you at the 51st
        percentile for openness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be higher in openness than 51 of them and lower
        in openness than 48 of them.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The closest synonym for openness (rather than openness to experience, which encompasses openness and intellect)
        is creativity. People who are average in openness or creativity find beauty reasonably important. They may enjoy an
        outlet for their creative ability, but will not wither away without it. They can appreciate art or beautiful crafts.
        They are somewhat sensitive to color and architectural form. They sometimes enjoy collecting, but it is rare for them to
        pursue it passionately. They are reasonably imaginative, and may daydream and reflect on occasion. They tend to enjoy
        music, often of the more conventional popular forms, and may be somewhat musical or artistic themselves (both of these
        are rare in the general population). They do not generally become so immersed in a book, or a movie, or in their own
        thoughts, that they lose touch with the outside world. They are interested in but by no means obsessed with beauty,
        creativity and art.</p>
      <br>
      <p>People of typical or average openness tend to be quite stable and reasonably conventional (particularly if they
        are also average or above in conscientiousness). At least moderate levels of openness tend to be necessary for
        entrepreneurial success, and prove comparatively useful at the top of hierarchies, even in very conservative occupations such as
        banking, accounting and law, which need creative people in leadership positions to provide new vision and
        direction. Liberals are higher in openness than conservatives (although the biggest difference between the two is openness
        to experience, at the trait level). Women are higher in openness than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is
        56.5. For men it is 44.5.</p>
