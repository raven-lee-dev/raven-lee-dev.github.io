      <br>
      <h3>What is Your Long-Term Goal<div>Or Career Path?</div></h3>
      <br>
      <p>I’m seeking to specialize in the domain of full stack development and equip myself with requisite skills that will
      enable me to reenter the remote labor force after a substantial period of absence, or at the very least, participate in
      the gig economy. Beyond that, my career trajectory may include furthering studies in Comp Sci and exploring the
      cybersecurity industry.</p>

      <h3>A Description of Your Strengths and<div>Limitations When it Comes to Learning</div>
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>I think one of my strengths is my ability to grasp concepts across a broad range of topics relatively quickly, but a
      major downfall is my tendency to ruminate on any given topic, to the point where I can obsess over something, labor on
      scope for far too long and consequently not learn about a subject on a deeper level.</p>

      <h3>Explain How You Will Manage Yourself to Work Productively and Safely With Other Learners, Facilitators, and Industry/Community Representatives</h3>
      <br>
      <p>I plan to stick to the Pomodoro timer and the course curriculum.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What Will You Do When Things Are Building Up and Starting to Get to You?</h3>
      <br>
      <p>I see a psychologist on a weekly basis, and my psychiatrist on a monthly basis, so if necessary, I'll offload on them, take a break, go for a walk, and/or engage in transcendental mediation to reset and restore balance.</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Any Scheduling Information Such as Block-Out Times When You Are Committed to Other Things. For Example, You Might Have Whanau Commitments Like School Drop-Offs. It's Important to Plan These In.</h3>
      <br>
      <p>I live with my parents on their farms and they oversee my children’s daily homeschooling activities. With the exception of my kids’ weekly Air Training Corps commitments (and occasional weekend activities and camps), and my 1-hour weekly
      therapy session with my psychologist, all other extra-curricula activities fall outside business hours.</p>
