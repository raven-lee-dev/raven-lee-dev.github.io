    <h2 id="gradient-text">The JS, HTML & CSS Relationship</h2>
    <br>
    <p>An analogy I would use to describe the relationship between HTML, CSS & JavaScript is an automobile. If you consider HTML the chassis of the car, it provides the structural and organizational foundation upon which other objects and elements/components sit.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You could then visualize CSS as the styling elements of the vehicle's exterior (and interior) which is often the first aspect of a vehicle that captures people's attention and can lead to further interest, inspection and interaction.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In describing JavaScript's role in web development, I'd compare it to the engine of an automobile. A stock-standard vehicle will function as intended, but additions, modifications, and eliminations to the engine (and the vehicle's interior and exterior components) can radically transform the performance, weight, speed and functionality of the car, thereby making the vehicle fit-for-purpose.</p>

    <h2 id="gradient-text">Control Flow & Loops</h2>
    <br>
    <p>There are three main types of control flow. Repetitive, sequential, and conditional. They are also collectively referred to as iteration, sequence, and selection logic. Looping describes the act of repeating a programmed process (also called a statement) until an explicitly stated set of criteria has been met.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Taking the example of iteration and loops, I would consider this to be the equivalent of repititiously performing some rote task that you've been ordered to do (e.g. physical training in defense forces), until such time that you're instructed to stop.</p>

    <h2 id="gradient-text">DOM & Interactions</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The DOM is an acronym for Document Object Model. It is a web API that interfaces with the BOM (Browser Object Model) and provides structural organization for the HTML document and its objects (all the various types of elements/nodes that comprise the HTML document's contents) so that they can be accessed and manipulated using programming languages to styllize elements and extend functionality. Typically, these languages are CSS and JavaScript. One way you can interact with the DOM is through a browser's built-in console found in the web developer tools section of your chosen browser. </p>

    <h2 id="gradient-text">Access Methods for Arrays vs. Objects</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Assuming the arrays and objects aren't nested inside other similar (or the same type) of elements, the means for accessing each type are different. In the case of arrays (defined as special types of objects), these are accessed by referencing the index position number for the array element you want. An example would be an array that consists of a list of 10 of your all-time favorite artists. The array would index them starting with position 0, through 9. Imaginging that the artist you wish to access occupies index position 8, you would call the array and use the index operator [] placing the index position (8) inside the square brackets.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The following example illustrates this.</p>
