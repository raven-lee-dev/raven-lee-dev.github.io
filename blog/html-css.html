      <h2>Criminal Profiling</h2>
      <br>
      <p>The FBI formed its Behavioral Science Unit in 1974 to study serial predators. Since then, the art and craft of
        criminal
        profiling have become the subject of numerous books, TV shows and iconic films such as The Silence of the Lambs.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Continuing the trend, the Netflix series Mindhunter explores the early efforts of the FBI to understand and
        profile
        serial killers. Mindhunter is based in part on the writings of best-selling author Mark Olshaker and legendary
        FBI
        profiler John Douglas.</p>

      <h2>Sowell - Black Redneck and White Liberals</h2>
      <br>
      <p>‘I use the term “intertemporal abstractions” by which I mean abstractions going back over the centuries. For
        example,
        prior to World War I, Germans living in what would become Czechoslovakia were better off than the Czechs and had
        been
        for centuries. When Czechoslovakia was carved out of the Hapsburg Empire after World War I, one of the things
        Czech
        officials, supported by Czech intellectuals, set out to do was correct the injustices of the 17th century.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Of course, nobody from the 17th century was alive. But only if you think of Czechs and Germans as part of some
        intertemporal abstraction does such a goal have any meaning much less justification. And when you realize how
        hard it is
        for contemporaries to get along, the thought that you are going to redress the wrongs of past centuries is
        staggering.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Ultimately, what buying into that means is that a baby born into the world comes with pre-packaged grievances
        against
        another baby born the same day. You’re setting them up for all kinds of strife to correct things they have no
        capacity
        to correct. The 17th century is going to remain what it was for all time. At the same time you can set in motion
        a
        series of polarizations which in the case of Czechoslovakia brought tragedy to both the Germans and the Czechs.'

      <h2>Hilarious Sowell Quotes</h2>
      <br>
      <p>“No government of the left has done as much for the poor as capitalism has. Even when it comes to the
        redistribution of
        income, the left talks the talk but the free market walks the walk.
        What do the poor most need? They need to stop being poor. And how can that be done, on a mass scale, except by
        an
        economy that creates vastly more wealth? Yet the political left has long had a remarkable lack of interest in
        how wealth
        is created. As far as they are concerned, wealth exists somehow and the only interesting question is how to
        redistribute
        it.” ― Thomas Sowell, Controversial Essays</p>
      <br>
      <p>“Socialism in general has a record of failure so blatant that only an intellectual could ignore or evade it.” ―
        Thomas Sowell</p>
      <br>
      <p>“Socialism is a wonderful idea. It is only as a reality that it has been disastrous. Among people of every
        race, color,
        and creed, all around the world, socialism has led to hunger in countries that used to have surplus food to
        export....
        Nevertheless, for many of those who deal primarily in ideas, socialism remains an attractive idea -- in fact,
        seductive.
        Its every failure is explained away as due to the inadequacies of particular leaders.” ― Thomas Sowell</p>
      <br>
      <p>“Can you cite one speck of hard evidence of the benefits of "diversity" that we have heard gushed about for
        years?
        Evidence of its harm can be seen — written in blood — from Iraq to India, from Serbia to Sudan, from Fiji to the
        Philippines. It is scary how easily so many people can be brainwashed by sheer repetition of a word.”
        ― Thomas Sowell</p>
      <br>
      <p>“I have never understood why it is "greed" to want to keep the money you have earned but not greed to want to
        take
        somebody else's money.” ― Thomas Sowell, Barbarians inside the Gates and Other Controversial Essays</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        “Freedom has cost too much blood and agony to be relinquished at the cheap price of rhetoric.” ― Thomas Sowell,
        Knowledge And Decisions</p>
